## 📝 My Process

### 🔧 Built With
- Semantic HTML5  
- CSS (Flexbox)  
- Mobile-first design  
- Google Font: Outfit  

### 📚 What I Learned
This was my first Frontend Mentor challenge.  
I learned:
- How to center a card using Flexbox  
- How to apply spacing, radius, shadows  
- How to match colors from a style guide  
- How to follow a given design closely  
- How to structure a simple component with clean HTML and CSS  

### 🔄 Continued Development
In future projects, I want to improve:
- Writing more organized CSS (using classes instead of inline `<style>`)  
- Learning responsive layouts  
- Using external CSS files  
- Following perfect spacing like design files  

### 🔗 Useful Resources
